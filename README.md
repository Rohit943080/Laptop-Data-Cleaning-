# Laptop Data Cleaning
## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and transforming a raw laptop dataset using SQL to make it suitable for analysis and reporting. The raw data contained inconsistent formats, embedded attributes, and non-atomic values. Using SQL-based transformations, the dataset was normalized, enriched with derived features, and structured for analytical use cases.

The project demonstrates practical SQL data cleaning skills, commonly required in data analyst roles.
